[Sameer Srivastava](https://haas.berkeley.edu/faculty/srivastava-sameer/) is the Ewald T. Grether Professor of Business Administration and Public Policy at UC Berkeley’s Haas School of Business and serves as chair of the Management of Organizations group. He is also affiliated with UC Berkeley Sociology. His research uses computational methods to: (1) unpack the complex interrelationships between group culture, individual cognition, and interpersonal networks; and (2) examine how they jointly relate to individual attainment and organizational performance. He holds AB, AM, MBA, and PhD degrees from Harvard University.

**Consonance Versus Dissonance: How Exposure to Unfamiliar Colleagues Within and Across Network Communities Affects Social Belonging and Network Change**. Organizations vary in the degree to which their members experience social belonging. Interventions designed to boost belonging have typically focused on changing individuals’ mindsets. We instead develop a structural intervention that seeks to foster belonging by exposing people to unfamiliar colleagues—ones they are not in regular contact with. We consider two forms of such exposure: consonant, to colleagues from the same network community as the focal actor; and dissonant, to colleagues from different network communities. We hypothesize that consonant exposure engenders more group solidarity, more persistent relationships, and enhanced social belonging. We test these expectations in a pre-registered field experiment at a non-profit organization. Participants (N=213) engaged in a facilitated professional development experience with unfamiliar colleagues and were randomly assigned to either consonant or dissonant groups. Although the anticipated solidarity advantage of consonant exposure was only marginally significant when assessed immediately following the intervention, consonant-condition participants maintained more intervention-group ties and reported greater social belonging three months after the intervention. Yet, pointing to the potential tradeoffs of consonant versus dissonant exposure, dissonant-condition participants experienced steeper declines in network constraint and greater increases in betweenness and closeness centrality. We discuss implications for research on social networks, workplace belonging, and organizational intervention.

[Benjamin Golub](https://bengolub.net/) is an American economist who is a professor of economics and computer science at Northwestern University. His research focuses on the economics of networks. He was named the winner of the 2020 biannual Calvó-Armengol International Prize, which recognizes a “top researcher in [e]conomics or social sciences younger than 40 years old for contributions to the theory and comprehension of the mechanisms of social interaction.”

**Incentive design with spillovers**. How should contracts be designed to motivate a group of agents to work efficiently toward a risky outcome, such as a scientific advance? This is a fundamental question about optimal contracting for teamwork, and the framework to formalize it is nearly 50 years old. Nevertheless, economics has made little progress on this problem for general team production technologies. We solve the problem by combining insights from contract theory and the theory of network games. The talk will also discuss using recent advances in large-matrix statistics to address realistic cases in which the network of collaborations and spillovers is not known to the designer, and which offer a variety of open avenues for both theoretical and empirical research. The talk will be accessible to an interdisciplinary social science audience.

[Eleanor Power](https://www.lse.ac.uk/Methodology/People/Academic-Staff/Eleanor-Power/Eleanor-Power) is an Associate Professor in the Department of Methodology. She completed her PhD in Anthropology at Stanford University in 2015. Prior to joining LSE in 2017, she was an Omidyar Postdoctoral Fellow at the Santa Fe Institute.

Eleanor is an anthropologist interested in how belief, practice, and identity interact with and shape interpersonal relationships. She looks at how people work to discern something of the character, moral being, and intentions of their peers through their actions, and equally how people strive to communicate something of themselves to others, both in dramatic and in subtle ways. She studies how such actions and reactions form the basis not only of people’s perceptions of one another, but also form the substance of their relationships and the emergent structure of their social world.

**Generosity and Reputational Concern Across Cultures: Networked Dictator Games in Five Countries.** We conduct experimental economic games to study how reputational stake influences people’s decision-making. Players make a series of “Dictator Game” decisions, splitting an endowment between themselves and a recipient. Crucially, recipients are not anonymous strangers but are other community members, presented via photo on a custom Android app. By varying the identity of the recipient and whether they will come to know the identity of the donor, we effectively vary the reputational exposure of the donor's decision.  We expect that players will be more generous when their decisions have greater reputational stake. This greater reputational stake could come from: the revelation of the donor's identity, the social proximity of donor and recipient, and their respective network positions. We conduct these games in seven rural communities in five countries (India, Colombia, Nepal, Morocco, and Mexico), where we already have full sociodemographic and social network data. This entails (so far) almost 1400 players and almost 40,000 allocation decisions.
 
While there is substantial cross-site variation in the average amount given (implying different cultural norms), we find strikingly similar effects of social proximity and revelation across sites. Donors give more of their endowment to friends or friends-of-friends, as opposed to more distant recipients. We further find a small but consistent effect of revelation on Dictator Game allocations: donors give more of their endowment when their identity is revealed, as opposed to being kept anonymous. There is greater heterogeneity in how revelation interacts with social proximity and the network position of donor and recipient, the implications of which we discuss.
